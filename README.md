# Cocktail Bar
Cocktail Bar is an app developed in python using [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) API. This use of the API is only for development purpose and educational use, so it is why I used a test API key.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Danteps-4/Cocktail-Bar.git
cd Cocktail-Bar
pip install tabulate
pip install requests
python main.py
```

The app is executed in the terminal with the command `python main.py`. It will display a menu with different options and then the user will select one of the options entering the corresponding number.

> **Note:** The app will be modified and developed into a desktop and web app for a better user experience.
